This paper looks to compute functions and values by numerical approximation. The method used is Taylors theorem, where the paper will focused on explaining Taylor series and polynomials, radius of convergence and the Lagrange remainder. Afterwards approximations for three trigometric functions and pie is found, where the approximations for pie is mostly computed through a python script.
